<h3 align="left">Web Automation Testing on LEADS Project using Selenium</h3>

This project is for web automation testing on SIFU - Market Profiling website.

ðŸŒ± I'm using Selenium Framework with Unittest and Python Programming Language for the scripting. Basically, there are 2 files in this MP folder.  

1) **main.py - For the testcase**
2) **Login.py - For the locators of the elements**

ðŸŒ± I'm using Selenium testing tools to automate the combination of filter in this Market Profiling website and then display the dashboard. 

ðŸŒ± The combination of filter is including the dropdown options for Segment, Product, Region, State, Business Zone and Market Center.
