Web Automation Testing on LEADS Project using Selenium

This project is for web automation testing on SIFU - Market Profiling website. 
I'm using Selenium Framework with Unittest and Python Programming Language for the scripting. Basically, there are 2 files in this MP folder.  

1) Main.py - For the testcase
2) - For the locators of the elements
