Web Automation Testing on LEADS Project using Selenium

This project is for web automation testing on SIFU - Market Profiling website. 
I'm using Selenium Framework with Unittest and Python Programming Language for the scripting. Basically, there are 2 files in this MP folder.  

1) main.py - For the testcase
2) Login.py - For the locators of the elements

I'm using Selenium testing tools to automate the combination of filter in this Market Profiling website and then display the dashboard. The combination of filter is including the dropdown options for Segment, Product, Region, State, Business Zone and Market Center. 

Below attached is the screenshots of the Market Profiling website on Overview Page.
